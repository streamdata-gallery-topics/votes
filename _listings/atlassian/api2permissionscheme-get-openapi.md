    ### About permission schemes and grants

    A permission scheme is a collection of permission grants. A permission grant consists of a `holder` and a `permission`.

    #### Holder

    The `holder` object contains information about the user or group being granted the permission. For example, the _Administer projects_ permission is granted to a group named _Teams in space administrators_. In this case, the type is `"type": "group"`, and the parameter is the group name, `"parameter": "Teams in space administrators"`. The `holder` object is defined by the following properties:

    *   `type` Identifies the user or group (see the list of types below).
    *   `parameter` The value of this property depends on the `type`. For example, if the `type` is a group, then you need to specify the group name.

    The following `types` are available. The expected values for the `parameter` are given in parenthesis (some `types` may not have a `parameter`):

    *   `anyone` Grant for anonymous users.
    *   `applicationRole` Grant for users with access to the specified application (application name). See [Manage application access](https://confluence.atlassian.com/cloud/manage-application-access-744721629.html) for more information.
    *   `assignee` Grant for the user currently assigned to an issue.
    *   `group` Grant for the specified group (group name).
    *   `groupCustomField` Grant for a user in the group selected in the specified custom field (custom field ID).
    *   `projectLead` Grant for a project lead.
    *   `projectRole` Grant for the specified project role (project role ID).
    *   `reporter` Grant for the user who reported the issue.
    *   `sd.customer.portal.only` Jira Service Desk only. Grants customers permission to access the customer portal but not Jira. See [Customizing Jira Service Desk permissions](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/24dKLg) for more information.
    *   `user` Grant for the specified user (user ID).
    *   `userCustomField` Grant for a user selected in the specified custom field (custom field ID).
